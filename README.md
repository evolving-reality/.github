## What does ESVR do?
ESVR is a tool that allows you to control a virtual reality environment with your brainwaves. It is a tool that allows you to explore the world of virtual reality without the use of your hands.

## How does ESVR work?
ESVR uses a headset that is connected to an EEG. The EEG is connected to a computer that is running a virtual reality environment. The EEG reads your brainwaves and sends them to the computer via a Bluetooth IOT device. The computer then uses the brainwaves to control the virtual reality environment.

## How do I use ESVR?
To get started you need to have the ESVR software and an STM IOT device. The software can be downloaded from the [ESVR Github](
