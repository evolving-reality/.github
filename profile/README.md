# Evolving Solutions Virtual Reality (ESVR)

## What is ESVR?
ESVR is a combination of a Virtual Reality Headset and an electroencephalogram EEG.

## What does ESVR do?
ESVR is a tool that allows you to control a virtual reality environment with your brainwaves. It is a tool that allows you to explore the world of virtual reality without the use of your hands.

## How does ESVR work?
ESVR uses a headset that is connected to an EEG. The EEG is connected to a computer that is running a virtual reality environment. The EEG reads your brainwaves and sends them to the computer via a Bluetooth IOT device. The computer then uses the brainwaves to control the virtual reality environment.

## How do I use ESVR?
To get started you need to have the ESVR software and an STM IOT device. The software can be downloaded from the [ESVR Github](https://github.com/evolving-reality/esvr-software.git). The STM IOT device can be purchased from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/STM32-Bluetooth-Module-Bluetooth-Communication/dp/B01N9QZQ3G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1519780003&sr=8-1&keywords=stm32+iot+device).
