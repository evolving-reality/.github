# Evolving Software Virtual Reality (ESVR)

## What is ESVR?
ESVR is a combination of a Virtual Reality Headset and an electroencephalogram EEG.

## What does ESVR do?
ESVR is a tool that allows you to control a virtual reality environment with your brainwaves. It is a tool that allows you to explore the world of virtual reality without the use of your hands.

## How does ESVR work?
ESVR uses a headset that is connected to an EEG. The EEG is connected to a computer that is running a virtual reality environment. The EEG reads your brainwaves and sends them to the computer via a Bluetooth IOT device. The computer then uses the brainwaves to control the virtual reality environment.

## How do I use ESVR?

### Easy Mode
Purchase an preloaded ESVR headset from the [ESVR Store](https://www.evolvingsoftware.io/esvr) The headset will come with a preloaded virtual reality environment and a preloaded EEG. The headset will also come with a preloaded computer that is ready to use. All you have to do is put on the headset and start exploring the virtual reality environment.
### Hard Mode

To get started you need to have the ESVR software and an STM IOT device. The software can be downloaded from the [ESVR Github](https://github.com/evolving-reality/esvr-software.git). The ST IOT device can be purchased from [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/STM32-Nucleo-Development-STM32F446RE-NUCLEO-F446RE/dp/B01I8XLEM8/ref=asc_df_B01I8XLEM8?tag=bingshoppinga-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=80539281984696&hvnetw=o&hvqmt=e&hvbmt=be&hvdev=c&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=&hvtargid=pla-4584138858920468&psc=1). Once you have the software and the IOT device you can start exploring the virtual reality environment.
